How asset tracking works in this app
	Stocks
* For initially adding the asset to the app, The app will ask the user (1) which stock they own (e.g. Google, VTI) and (2) how many they own. E.g. 2 Google stocks and (3) what date the stock was acquired. This is saved as their “Google stock account” on their “All accounts” page, reflecting the total value of their Google stocks based on today’s price.
* The app will continuously track how much that account is worth by tracking the value of Google stocks on the stock market. E.g. let’s say the Google stock is worth $100 today when the account is set up, but rises to $110 a week later when the user checks the app again. The “Google stock account” card on the “All accounts” page should show in the graph area that the value of the “Google stock account” has risen from $200 to $220 (given that the user reported they have 2 Google stocks). 
* At any time, the user can update the number of stocks they own in this account by tapping the “update” button on the account, which opens an “update account” page (also referred to as the “update asset” page in this doc and elsewhere)
* The “update asset” page allows the user to update the number of shares of this stock the user owns, and specify what date the number of shares changed. For example, the user updates the number of Google stocks from 2 to 5 on November 7. 
* Once this has been updated, the “Google stock account” card on “All accounts” will show the updated total monetary value of the user’s Google stock holdings in the graph, starting on the date the user specified (November 7). 
* IMPORTANT for some users, they will not know the exact number of shares they own, but know their account value. The app should be able to also ask for the monetary value of of their Google stock holdings, and calculate the number of shares in reverse, and use this to calculate and show account values.
